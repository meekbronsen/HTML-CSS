<!-- A phone with a scale factor of 2x means it's going to render each pixel of the image using 2px on the device -->

<!-- device have physical resolution and logical resolution -->

<!-- physical resolution. fixed pixels of the device -->
<!-- logical resolution. how the device behaves, e.g the device always scales the resolution of the image to fit the screen-->
<!-- css is based on the logical resolution -->
<!-- Device Pixel Ratio (DPR). the ratio of physical/logical, the scaling ratio -->
<!-- devices have a dpr of 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3 -->
<!-- but we should only worry about 2 and 3 -->
<!-- A high density screen is a screen with a dpr greater than one -->
<!-- providing images for different screens with different dpr use the srcset  -->
