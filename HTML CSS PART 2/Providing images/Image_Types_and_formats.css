/* In computers there are two types of images: */
/* Raster made up of pixels */
/* Vector images which are defined by lines and curves */

/* In Raster Images the more the pixels the larger the image size */

/* Raster Image formats jpeg, PNG, GIF, Webp */
/* Preferred format is png and webp ,since jpeg does not support animations and gif only supports upto 256 colors */
